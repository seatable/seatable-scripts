# SQL function reference

You can use supported functions in SQL query statements.

## Functions for SQL

With functions you can transform, calculate, combine or merge the values of other columns from the current table. On top of that, functions can refer to each other.

The functions supported in SQL are roughly the same as the set of functions supported by formulas in SeaTable.

The basic syntax of functions is as follows:

```
FunctionName(parameters...)

```

The parameters can be number,string,constants,column name or other functions. Column name cannot be an alias. If the column name contains "-", you can use "`" to enclose it.

Currently SQL query offers the following functions:

* Operands
* Mathematical functions
* Text functions
* Date functions
* Geo functions
* Logical functions
* Statistical functions

In this article, we will show you a complete overview of all functions with examples. If you are looking for a specific function, you can use the Ctrl+F to quickly find an entry on this page.

## Functions with examples

You can use the following constants in the function:

| OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION                           | INPUT   | RESULT     |
| :------- | :------------------------------------ | :------ | :--------- |
| e        | Returns the Euler number e=2.71828... | e+1     | 3.71828183 |
| pi       | Returns the circle number Pi.         | pi      | 3.14159265 |
| true()   | Returns the logical value 'true'.     | true()  | true       |
| false()  | Returns the logical value 'false'.    | false() | false      |

### Operands

Parameters must be strings or numbers. If a number is passed to a parameter that expects a string, it'll be converted to string, and vice versa.

| exact(string1, string2)                                | Checks whether two character strings (string1, string2) are exactly identical. Returns the values 'true' or 'false' respectively. Case sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | exact('SeaTable', 'Seatable')                     | false                        |
| find(findString, sourceString, startPosition)          | Returns the start position of a string (findString) within another string (sourceString). It is case sensitive. Without find, 0 is returned. If the start position (startPosition) is given as decimal, it is rounded down. If the cell in the column for the keyword (findString) is still empty, 1 is returned. If the cell in the column for the target string (sourceString) is still empty, an empty value ('') is returned.     | find('Sea', 'seaTable', 1)                        | 0                            |

This 'startPosition' has no influence on the result: it always returns the absolute start position. If the 'startPosition' of the character string to be searched for (findString) is given after the actual start position of the character string (sourceString), 0 is returned, since nothing was found from this position.                                                  | find('table', 'big table', 4)                     | 5                            |

However, if start position (startPosition) and number (count) are given as decimal, they are rounded down. Too much count is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | mid('SeaTable is the best.', 10.9, 27.3)          | is the best.                 |
| replace(sourceString, startPosition, count, newString) | Replaces a part (count) of a character string (sourceString) from a certain start position (startPosition) with another character string (newString). The number (count) of characters is only taken into account for the old string (sourceString), but not for the new string (newString).                                                                                                                                          | replace('SeaTable is the best.', 1, 8, 'Seafile') | Seafile is the best.         |

| search(findString, sourceString, startPosition)        | Returns the start position of a string (findString) within another string (sourceString). It is not case-sensitive. Without find, 0 is returned. If the start position (startPosition) is given as decimal, it is rounded down. If the cell in the column for the keyword (findString) is still empty, 1 is returned. If the cell in the column for the target string (sourceString) is still empty, an empty value ('') is returned. | search('Sea', 'seaTable', 1)                      | 1                            |

| substitute(sourceString, oldString, newString, index)  | Replaces existing text (oldString) with new text (newString) in a string (sourceString). If there is more than one text (oldString) in the string (sourceString), only the 'index'-th text is replaced. The text is case-sensitive.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | substitute('SeaTableTable', 'Table', 'file', 1)   | SeafileTable                 |

### Date functions

When passing a parameter with time or date type, you can specify a contant in "2021-09-01 12:00:01" or "2021-09-01" format. When you query the result of a date function in SQL, the result will be converted to a string in RFC3339 format, e.g. "2021-09-03T00:00:00+02:00". Please note that if a date function returns a date type, it cannot be used as parameter for text or maths functions.
